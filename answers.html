//PART 1

1) mkdir first

5) cp another.txt copy.txt 
6) rm copy.txt

//PART 2

1) lists the manual for a given command. You can scroll with your cursor and press "q" to get out.
2) 
-l: (The lowercase letter ``ell''.)  List in long format.  (See
below.)  A total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line
before the long listing.
-a: Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.)
3) option left/right 
4) option + e 
5) option + a

7) A shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. Most often the user interacts with the shell using a command-line interface (CLI). The terminal is a program that opens a graphical window and lets you interact with the shell. The terminal runs a shell and allows us to enter commands, the shell is the program that actually processes commands and outputs results.
8) An absolute path is a path that starts from the root route and gives the complete location for a file or folder.
9) A relative path is a path that starts at the current location and not the root route.
10) Flags can change and even enhance commands and are added using a - after the command. I've added -rf to rm when deleting a folder, -r to cp when copying a file, and -a to ls when vieiwng hidden files or files whose name begins with a (.).
11) Deletes a folder.
